# Clean Code Exercise

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Make sure everything works:

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

## Run tests

Run tests in watch mode so you can see if they break when you make a change:

```sh
pnpm test:watch
```

## Goal

Examine the code in `index.ts` and try to refactor it to make it cleaner and more maintainable.
`index.test.ts` could do with a bit of a tidy-up too if you have the time.
