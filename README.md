# Clean Code Exercise

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Make sure everything works:

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

## Run

Run the program by running `pnpm transform` and adding extra words after:

```sh
pnpm transform the quick brown fox
```

## Goal

Examine the code (ignore `index.ts`) and try to improve it by applying clean code principles.
Run the lints and tests to make sure you didn't break anything.
